# Question
Why would you want to use a `\b` character class instead of a `\s` character class?

# Answer
    We would want to use '\b' instead of '\s' because \b is meant for any word breaks while \s is for any whitespace character like spaces. 

# Teacher Feedback

`\b` will help with finding specific characters and words at the bound of the string, so looking for a word at the beginning or end of the word. So `\b` would find a word even if after the word there is a comma or exclamation not just empty space!
